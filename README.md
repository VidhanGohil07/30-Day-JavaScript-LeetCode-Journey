# ðŸ§  30-Day JavaScript LeetCode Journey

Welcome to my 30-day challenge where I solve one LeetCode problem each day using **JavaScript**. This journey is all about building consistency, improving problem-solving skills, and getting more comfortable with algorithms and data structures.

## ðŸ’¡ Why I Started This Challenge

I wanted to:
- Sharpen my JavaScript coding skills
- Prepare for technical interviews
- Stay consistent with daily practice
- Learn from patterns and build logical thinking

Whether you're a beginner or revising for interviews, I hope you find this repo helpful!
